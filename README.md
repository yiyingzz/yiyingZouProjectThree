My version of Simon Says-- hence, Yiying Yells-- a game to test your memory with light-up blocks.

## Functionality

- Users watch the blocks change colour in a sequence then try to click them in the correct order.
- If the user gets it right, a new sequence with one additional block will be generated and the game goes on
- If the user gets it wrong, they get one more chance to click the blocks
- The game keeps track of the user's longest correct guess

## Made with

- HTML5
- CSS3, Sass
- JavaScript, jQuery
- VS Code
